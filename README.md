# Marvel Cinema (and beyond) Calendar

MCC is a simple app built to display upcoming air dates for Marvel movies and TV shows.

One day I was browsing the internets, looking for an easy one-click solution which would add all of the upcoming Marvel movies to my Google calendar. I figured SOMEONE must have made something like that. But no. Everything I found was either outdated information or just links to spreadsheets on Google Docs. So screw it, I made my own. 

This project began life as static page built with regular old JS, CSS, and HTML, deployed with Surge. But as time went on it became more involved, and I decided that some sort of CMS would be a huge benefit. I rebuilt the site with Meteorjs and the Orion CMS package.
